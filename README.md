FRONTEND  - MIDDLE-END - BACKEND

- We need an intermediate layer between the client side and the microservices
- Using this middle end, when client sends request we will be able to make decision that which microservice should actually respond to this request
- We can do message validation, response transformation, rate limiting
- We try to make an API Gateway that acts as this middle end

Different Microservices Links:

- Flight Booking Service https://github.com/nikdhruv05/FlightTicketBookingService
- Flight Search Service https://github.com/nikdhruv05/Flight_Search_Service
- Authentication Service https://github.com/nikdhruv05/Authorisation_Service
- Reminder Service https://github.com/nikdhruv05/Reminder_Service
